# BBC-News-article-Topic-Identification
In this project our task is to identify major themes/topics across a collection of BBC news articles. we can use clustering algorithms such as Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) etc.The dataset contains a set of news articles for each major segment consisting of business, entertainment, politics, sports and technology. We need to create an aggregate dataset of all the news articles and perform topic modeling on this dataset. We verify whether these topics correspond to the different tags available.
